#Some changes were made to REACTORS and REACTORS_STATUS.ratdb along the way.  So far,

In REACTORS.ratdb:
  REACTOR_SPECTRUMs "PHWR_Satoko" and "PWRBWR_Satoko" did not have their 
  param_isotopes and param_compositions filled in (were in comments, just not put
  into the RATDB entry fields).  Filled those in.
